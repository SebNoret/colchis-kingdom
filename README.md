# Colchis-kingdom 

A simple HTML/CSS static website I create as an exercice to apply to a [Wildcodeschool](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/) course on agile testing and test automation.
It's a responsive website and there is an JS alert to indicate that the contact form message has been send when the user clicks on the submit button.
This project uses GULP for all the build tasks (assets minification and creation of a clean URLs structure).

## TODO

Add an animation when the responsive menu appears on small screens, create a modal message to replace the alert message on contact form, maybe create an english translated version of the website in a subfolder
